ManpMovieMaker allows the user to create animations from a series of png files created by ManpWIN. It can create intermediate frames to reduce the number of frames that need to be created. This can save a lot of time for deep zooms. It does this by resizing imjages and cropping them to the same image size as the originals. 

The output is initially a series of JPG files that can be used as input to ffmpeg to create mp4 animations. Scripts are created to allow assembly of the frames into ffmpeg and to add audio files from sources such as mp3 files.
